Okay, so just walked out of watching O'Dessa and I'm sitting here dazed on this cold metal bench outside the theater. My head feels like it's stuffed with cotton candy and I swear there’s popcorn dust in my hair. The movie, man... it was like a fever dream mixed with... I dunno, like a kaleidoscope of broken neon signs flickering my brain.

There was this part where she, you know, the main character, was just standing on a deserted highway, and there was this crazy lilac sky bleeding into orange, and I could feel my back aching just watching her stoic, like waiting for a bus that was never gonna come. And speaking of aches, how does a seat even get that uncomfortable? Isn't there a law against that? My lumbar is suing me. But anyway, that highway scene, it was like she was on the edge of the world, right? Or like... she was trying to download the universe into her brain, one byte at a time.

> When the music kicked in, it's like it was clawing its way into my chest—not in a bad way, but like, damn. It was like those old VHS tapes, where the sound sometimes just spirals out into static. Crazy how the vibes could shift from that eerie silence to this cacophony, like the composer was having a conversation with an octopus in a blender. Wait, that's weird. Forget I said that.

Some dude behind me kept unwrapping candies, and every crinkle was like a gunshot in a library. And then BAM—O'Dessa is breaking into that abandoned house with the windows flickering like a haunted disco ball. My teeth actually started to chatter, and I wasn’t even cold. It's like when you find a goldfish in your shoe and you’re just like... why?

Honestly, if you're going to watch the movie, maybe bring a blanket. Or a pillow. But not because it’s boring—it’s like the opposite of boring—more like a dream you can't wake up from 'cause someone superglued your eyelids open. Download the movie, stream it, whatever. It needs a second watch, like when you try to find that one sock in the laundry but it keeps slipping out of existence.

Anyway, O'Dessa, she’s standing on that cliff... or was it a rooftop? My brain feels like it's been dunked in soda pop. The ending... can't even begin. It's like suddenly realizing you've been a character in someone else's dream all along. I'm still chewing on it, like a piece of stale gum you can't get rid of.

const emotionalResponse = () => {
    let confusion = Math.random()  100;
    let awe = Math.random()  100;
    if (confusion > awe) {
        return mind blown;
    } else {
        return heart stolen;
    }
};
